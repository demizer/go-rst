* Sun Feb 26 14:09 2017: Convert test checks to use testify package

* Sun Feb 14 22:38 2016: Fix gocyclo on https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/demizer/go-rst

* Thu Oct 20 00:41 2016: IMPLEMENT GOOD TESTS FOR INLINE MARKUP

* Tue Oct 11 00:10 2016: Document creating new tests

  * The UltiSnips Snippets should be mentioned.

  * document debugging tips

* Mon Oct 10 17:53 2016: sectionLevels.Add() should be renamed to AddOrReuse()

  In section.go#145 a section is added or existing is returned. We should rename this function from Add() to AddOrReuse() for
  self documentation.

* Mon Oct 10 01:44 2016: Need to add blockquote levels

  Like sectionLevels, but for blockquotes. Currently set to use a hack so I can get all the tests to pass.

  Try to make indentQueue more general; perhaps we can use it for blockquotes as well as bullet lists.

* Mon Oct 10 01:27 2016: Debug output should be more like the rst2psuedo command

  I like how this debug output prints the current line and what state the state machine is in. We should use something
  similar.

  Example:

  rst2pseudoxml testdata/03-test-section/03.00.04.00-section-bad-unexpected-titles.rst --debug

* Sat Feb 20 01:10 2016: Should we convert char12 and vert tab to spaces before proccessing?

  From the spec:

  Other whitespace characters (form feeds [chr(12)] and vertical tabs [chr(11)]) are converted to single spaces before processing.
