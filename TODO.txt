* Sun Feb 26 23:40 2017: register loggers

  use the SwapLogger luke: https://github.com/go-kit/kit/blob/988c05d06d8ee3a9c13782f0e49b2c6e4726388d/log/sync_test.go#L11

  this will make it easy to change the logger type

  RegisterNewContext(name, logger)

  sets pointers of arrays:

  Loggers = [ lexer.Logger, parser.Logger, ast.Logger ]

  so when someone does

  SetLogger(StdOut) // package root func

  we can set the Logger on all registered loggers:

  for ctx in Loggers:
    ctx.SetLogger(logger)


* Mon Feb 20 02:01 2017: Use travis CI for build status as drone.io is ded

* Fri Feb 17 14:45 2017: add tests for utf8 normalization

  Getting '\u2002' instead of '\u2000':

  name=lexer line=lexer.go:96 func=lexer.go msg="lexing line" line=" *EN QUAD* ,"
  name=lexer line=lexer.go:96 func=lexer.go msg="lexing line" line=" *EN QUAD* ,"

  Problem is starts with getu4 at lexer.go:46

  I had to disable the norm.NFC on import. This is not working.
  I will need to change loop through code points not individual runes on string array item

* Mon Jan 23 21:50 2017: Remove custom json similarity checks and used jsondiff (jd)

  The lexer/parser test checker is overly complex at about 2000 lines. We need to make sure the json output of the
  lexer/parser match the expected results and that's it. This can be done with the json diff library.

* Sun Feb 26 14:09 2017: Convert test checks to use testify package

* Sun Feb 14 22:38 2016: Fix gocyclo on https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/demizer/go-rst

* Sun Jan 22 02:45 2017: Add MarshalJSON() to all Nodes in node.go

  otherwise diff output on errors shows an index number and not the type!

* Sun Jan 22 00:26 2017: Use travis.ci for building grst

  drone.io went belly up, beta.drone.io doesn't allow me to login...

* Sat Jan 21 23:50 2017: Split up the parse package intq lexer, parser, and document

  * lexer package contains all the files starting with "lexer_"

  * parser package containes all files starting with "parse_"

  * document package containes all files starting with "node_"

  The parse directory is becoming too large because it contains three packages...

* Fri Feb 19 23:52 2016: Rename *Node to Node* in node.go

  NodeSystemMessage becomes SystemMessageNode

* Thu Oct 20 00:41 2016: CURRENTLY WORKING ON FINISHING GOOD TESTS FOR INLINE MARKUP

* Tue Oct 11 00:10 2016: Document creating new tests

  * The UltiSnips Snippets should be mentioned.

  * document debugging tips

* Mon Oct 10 17:53 2016: sectionLevels.Add() should do one thing

  In parse.go#399 a section is added or existing is returned. We should rename this function from Add() to AddOrReuse() for
  self documentation.

* Mon Oct 10 01:44 2016: Need to add blockquote levels

  Like sectionLevels, but for blockquotes. Currently set to use a hack so I can get all the tests to pass.

  Try to make indentQueue more general; perhaps we can use it for blockquotes as well as bullet lists.

* Mon Oct 10 01:27 2016: Debug output should be more like the rst2psuedo command

  I like how this debug output prints the current line and what state the state machine is in. We should use something
  similar.

  Example:

  rst2pseudoxml testdata/03-test-section/03.00.04.00-section-bad-unexpected-titles.rst --debug

* Sat Feb 20 01:10 2016: Should we convert char12 and vert tab to spaces before proccessing?

  From the spec:

  Other whitespace characters (form feeds [chr(12)] and vertical tabs [chr(11)]) are converted to single spaces before processing.

* Sun Feb 28 09:00 2016: renumber-items.sh should only take the test name, it should intelligently find the test and
  renumber.

* Sun Feb 28 09:21 2016: If I run a lex test directly then "startPosition" is set to 0. It should always be specified in the
  items.
