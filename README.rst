Current Work
------------

* **Translating the docutils tests from psuedo xml into JSON.**
* **Inline markup parsing**

TODO
----

See TODO.txt (or issues) for current active work. The following list is in order of importance, but not yet in progress:

* **Integration with Hugo**

  Need to finish inline-markup parsing to have something worth while for Hugo. See https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1436

* **rst2html conversion tool**

* **rst2confluence import/conversion tool**

  Confluence is garbage, it would be so nice to be able to alleviate the pain using reStructuredText. This has the lowest
  priority.

-----------------
How to contribute
-----------------

See the `doc` directory for more documentation and tip and tricks.

* **Convert tests into JSON**

  The docutils tests are implemented in a "psuedo xml" which is non-standard.
  Translating the tests into JSON has the benefit of making the reStructuredText
  tests programming language neutral so that reStructuredText parsers can be
  implemented in other programming languages. See
  https://github.com/demizer/go-rst/tree/master/testdata
  for more information.

* **Implement an element**

  Implement an element from the list above.

* **Write documentation**

  All projects need good documentation.

* **Test and report**

  Not actually possible in the current state, but using the library and writing
  bug reports is always helpful.
